MUST:
- look through code with singe responsibility, level of abstraction in mind
- refactor mosavid
    - horrible names, functions, types  
- memory limit reached on app engine

    get_best_fitting_frames and find_best_fitting_frame
        could return indeces instead of images

- create test that runs after deploy
    run e2e test/endpoint directly
- make quality tests for mosaic creation logic
    collect an image-video pair that produces nice result
    make a test with them
- refactor mosavid logic
    magic numbers
- refactor tests
    some are in the wrong module
    write test for long video, or somehow check that
        the video is processed in chunks


NICE_TO_HAVE:
- multiple comparison methods
- mosaic creation does not redirect
    therefore it remembers the form inputs
- progress bar
    let the user know something is happening
- error message for too big files
    filter request files based on size
- being able to reach the container through browser
    container runs locally with flask
    reach it from browser
    not easily possible using windows
