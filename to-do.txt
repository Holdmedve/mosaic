MUST:
- use container registry, github actions takes ages to build image every time
- find places to replace for loops with numpy operations
    - stitch_images_together
    - get_best_matching_frame_for_tile
        when looking for max similarity, also store the index
        avoid looping twice, but PROFILE to make sure this helps at all
    - mean_color_similarities
        sqrt szamolas lehetne np operation
- look through code with singe responsibility, level of abstraction in mind
- create test that runs after deploy
    run e2e test/endpoint directly
    test with highest tile count setting
        maybe measure time as well as an assertion for the test
- put files in folder
    - docker, requirements


NICE_TO_HAVE:
- multiple comparison methods
- mosaic creation does not redirect
    therefore it remembers the form inputs
- progress bar
    let the user know something is happening
- error message for too big files
    filter request files based on size
