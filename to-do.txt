MUST:

- memory limit reached on app engine
    - select fixed number of frames from video
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33523751/getting-specific-frames-from-videocapture-opencv-in-python
    sample(range(10000000), k=60)

    profile mosaic creation logic, optimize

    get_best_fitting_frames and find_best_fitting_frame
        could return indeces instead of images

- create test that runs after deploy
    run e2e test/endpoint directly
- make quality tests for mosaic creation logic
    collect an image-video pair that produces nice result
    make a test with them
- refactor mosavid logic
    magic numbers


NICE_TO_HAVE:
- multiple comparison methods
- mosaic creation does not redirect
    therefore it remembers the form inputs
- progress bar
    let the user know something is happening
- error message for too big files
    filter request files based on size
- being able to reach the container through browser
    container runs locally with flask
    reach it from browser
    not easily possible using windows
