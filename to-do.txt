MUST:
- align tests with the implementation changes
    there are multiple tests commented out
- memory limit reached on app engine
    profile mosaic creation logic, optimize
- create test that runs after deploy
    run e2e test/endpoint directly
- make quality tests for mosaic creation logic
    collect an image-video pair that produces nice result
    make a test with them
- make functional split level ui element
    dropdown of numbers
- refactor mosavid logic
    magic numbers
    dataclass for image, video, split level


NICE_TO_HAVE:
- multiple comparison methods
- mosaic creation does not redirect
    therefore it remembers the form inputs
- progress bar
    let the user know something is happening
- error message for too big files
    filter request files based on size
- being able to reach the container through browser
    container runs locally with flask
    reach it from browser
    not easily possible using windows
